Harry Nilsson - Gotta Get Up

Gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get home before the morning comes
What if I'm late, got a big day
Gotta get home before the sun comes up
Up and away, got a big day, sorry can't stay
I gotta run run, yeah
Gotta get home, pick up the phone
Gotta let the people know I'm gonna be late

[Verse 1]
There was a time when we could dance until a quarter to ten
We never thought it would end then
We never thought it would end
We used to carry on and drink and do the rock and roll
We never thought we'd get old, though
We never thought we'd grow cold, but now
