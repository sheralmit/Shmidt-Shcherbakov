[Verse 1]
I went to Paris (Texas)
With a suitcase in my hand
I had to leave
Knew they wouldn't understand

[Chorus]
When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It's time, it's time to go
When you know, you know
Then the more you know
It's time to go
=======
White flower, cinnamon on my teeth
And I'm sittin' in the stoplight in northern town
I feel lucky
I drive somewhere out of range, I don't know where
White noise comin' out of my brain
Turns off for nothing
